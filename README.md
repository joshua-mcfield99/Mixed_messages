# Mixed_messages
Mixed messages is a group project on Codecademy, This project has been created by Josh and Kubitisam.

## Tech we have used
In this project we have used:
+ HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
+ CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
+ .JS (Javascript)
+ .Json (for Array storage)

## What is this project about?
The aim of this project is to create a randomized message, i.e we have chosen Quotes from important people.
To make it randomized the pairing of quote author and date will all be **randomized** and should be some what jumbled but always in the form of:
1. Author name
2. Quote
3. The Date the person lived
These might match up correctly with the correct author/quote/date or it might be a different author for the quote and another authors life period/date they lived.
